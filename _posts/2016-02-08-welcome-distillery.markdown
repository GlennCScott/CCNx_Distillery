Here is where we will be able to announce, describe,
and even start discussions around the CCNx software broader
than what the issue tracker can support.

This came about as the result of a discussion about "release notes." We don't
really have releases, per se (although in the past we made bi-weekly snapshots
of built versions of CCNx). Instead there is a constant stream of updates that
are induced from our experience using the system, development of other projects,
discussions and advancements made in the various venus around ICN networking. As
a result, one could update the software multiple times per day.

So, in lieu of release notes, information that is likely to be
important to users of the CCNx software will be here.  From new features,
API changes, to requests for feedback on potential changes can be found here.

What is not here are blow-by-blow entries on case status or incremental
progress on some issue -- unless, of course, it is of wide interest.

Naturally what does show up here is a judgement call.
