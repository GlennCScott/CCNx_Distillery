Welcome to the Distillery blog. The idea here is that we will be able to
announce, describe, and even start discussions around the CCNx software.

This came about as the result of a discussion about "release notes." We don't
really have releases, per se (although in the past we made bi-weekly snapshots
of built versions of CCNx). Instead there is a constant stream up updates that
are induced from our experience using the system, development of other projects,
discussions and advancements made in the various venus around ICN networking. As
a result, one could update the software multiple times per day.

So, in lieu of release notes, information that is likely to be important to
users of the CCNx software will be here.  From new features, API changes,
requests for feedback on potential changes can be found here.

Naturally what does show up here is a judgement call.  I doubt that it makes
sense that every issue gets a mention here.
